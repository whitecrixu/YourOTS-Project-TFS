The Forgotten Server Plus

TFS+ is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in C++.
It is a fork of the [The Forgotten Server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) project.

We aim for rapid growth, development of new features and bringing back some most iconic content from the past.
